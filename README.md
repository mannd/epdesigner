# EP Designer

## Tool to create decision trees 

EP Designer is a tool to simplify the creation of decision trees and
to save them in a JSON format.  It is written for macOS.

## EP Designer is under development

At the moment EP Designer is pre-alpha and the main branch is the
development branch.

## Rationale

My app EP Mobile contains several decision trees, which are all
hard-coded into the app.  I am looking for a more general solution for
adding decision trees to the app.  Decision trees can be written in
JSON format, but this is very hard to do manually for deeply nested
trees.  So this app is at present for internal use in order to
generate decision trees for EP Mobile.  However I would like to add an
ability to run the trees in EP Designer, so that the app could
potentially be used by others to design and test out decision trees.
